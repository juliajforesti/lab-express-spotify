# [Express Spotify Searcher](https://my-spotify-app-project.herokuapp.com/)

This app was developed by me during the Web Development Bootcamp at Ironhack, as a proposed exercise, using Spotify's API, Express and Handlebars.
You can search your favorite artists, albums and listen to a sample of the tracks :zap:

### Summary of requirements of the exercise:

- Total of five pages with (1)artist / (2)album / (3)track information (all populated from Spotify) + (4)layout + (5)home.
- Some styling, it doesn't have to look like the example.
